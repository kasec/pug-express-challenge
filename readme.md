# Challenge with Express, Pug & Postgres

Steps to run:
```bash
> npm i
> npm start
```
thats it
you can check how it works

My databse connection was with mysql instead postgres, because i installed before mysql

> You must create .env file in source dir with follow properties

```env
PORT=[insert port] // without [], "". just raw data.
HOST=[insert host]
USER_DB=[insert user]
PASS_DB=[insert password]
DATABASE=[insert database name]
```

In my case a create database, you have to create empty datbase, the used tables will be created theyself.
